# Blog Card

A simple blog preview card built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
This project helped me practice layout techniques, semantic HTML, and styling components like buttons, text, and images.

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox layout

## 📸 Features

- Centered card using `display: flex`
- Clean, modern blog card layout
- Responsive and accessible styling
- Custom-styled button and border elements

## 💡 What I Learned

- I successfully used **Flexbox** to center the card, which gave me more control and confidence compared to using `margin: auto` in previous projects.
- I learned that using semantic HTML (like `<article>` and `<section>`) improves structure and accessibility.
- I realized that I don’t need to rely on elements like `<button>` just for visual styling—I can achieve the same effects with more semantic tags like `<h2>` and pure CSS.

## ⚠️ Challenges

- I struggled to apply `border-radius` to an SVG image. After several attempts using `overflow: hidden` and wrapping it in a `<div>`, I switched to a PNG version—which finally worked and allowed proper styling.
  
## 🤔 What I'd Do Differently

- Avoid using elements like `<button>` purely for styling. Next time, I’d add a border directly to semantic elements to keep the markup clean.
  
## 🙋‍♂️ Areas for Improvement

- **Semantic HTML**: I want to get better at using the right tags (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, etc.) for clearer structure.
- **CSS Selectors**: I’m still learning when to use direct selectors, class names, or specific child selectors for cleaner and more maintainable styles.
